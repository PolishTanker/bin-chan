# Bin-chan: A Temporary Text Sharing Web Application

## Overview

Bin-chan is a lightweight web application for securely sharing text snippets with an expiration time. Users can submit a piece of text, set an expiry time, and share a unique URL to access the text before it expires. After the set expiry time, the text is automatically deleted. This makes Bin-chan an ideal solution for sharing temporary or sensitive information.

## Features

1. **Temporary Text Sharing**: Users can submit and share text that will automatically expire after a set period (1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days).
2. **Custom URLs**: Users can optionally create a custom URL for the text they submit. If no custom URL is provided, a random 8-character string is generated.
3. **Text Size Limit**: Text submissions are limited to 6000 characters.
4. **Automatic Expiry**: Text is automatically deleted from the database after its expiration time.
5. **Alternate endpoint**: You can get the content of the share as plain text for cli aplications. Link changes to http://example.com/text/sharename 
6. **Password lock and encryption in database**: You can lock share with password. Additionaly it will be encrypted in database, in this way it will not be redable for server admin. you can pass password in curl if you need in cli. Link changes to http://example.com/text/sharename?password=pass
